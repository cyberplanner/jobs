### WHY DO YOU WANT THIS JOB?
* LexisNexis seems like a perfect environment for juniors like myself to gain experience.

* The emphasis on practising XP values and following the agile methodology is unlike any other company I applied for so far.

* I have some interest in dot.Net development but the fact that LexisNexis is adaptive and tech flexible is what makes it all the more attractive to me.

* Pairing and mob programming is practised within LexisNexis, and I really enjoy pairing. Not only it keeps things fresh but it does help with efficiency and focus when tackling problems too.

* It’s a chance to work on a variety of interesting projects and learning interesting subjects (AI, data visualisation and machine learning).

* I like the idea of being able to contribute freely to open source projects and participate in community initiatives.



### WHY SHOULD LexisNexis HIRE YOU?
* I'm an enthusiastic team player and I work very well with others.

* I have experience with the agile methodology and I practice XP values and believe they work.

* I'm always looking to develop my skills.

* I'm happy and willing to learn anything new. I don't have preferable language or tech (Tech agnostic). I'm also patient and fast learning and I take chance on every learning opportunity I get.

* I'm a good problem-solver with a can-do attitude, and I truly enjoy the challenge of breaking down a problem and finding answers which can be applied in the real world. I’m fixated on code craftsmanship and take pride in writing elegant, test-driven code.

* Since it was suggested that it would be better to apply in pairs, I'm submitting this application with my pairing partner: Jose Copovi-King (https://github.com/joseck0510), hoping that we both will get to collaborate together once again while working for LexisNexis.
