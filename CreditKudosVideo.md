# Hi..

Hi, I'm Sal.
I'm Makers graduate and a former graphic and web designer.
My main languages are Ruby and JavaScript
Although I like to think of myself as a language agnostic developer.
I have the means and I'm willing to learn any langauges or tools needed for what I'm building.

# Why am I applying for Credit Kudos

I love the idea of Credit Kudos. I myself suffered in the past with traditional credit checks and I think it's awesome that someone is doing something about it. I beleive that working for Credit Kudos is a great chance for learning, and learning and experience is all what I'm after..I look forward to learn more about Data science, machine learning.

# Why I'm a good fit for Credit Kudos:

Like any Maker I practice and beleive in XP values,
I love TDD and care deeply about Software craftsmanship and wiritng readable clean code.

I'm a fast learner and curios, I ask lots of questions and take every chance and opportunity to learn and improve.

As I said eariler Ruby is the language that I'm more experienced in and JavaScript is my second favourite language and Ruby is my favourite web framework thus I know I'll be able to contribute faster with minimal guidance.

Lastly, I'm a good problem solver, I enjoy a good challenge.
