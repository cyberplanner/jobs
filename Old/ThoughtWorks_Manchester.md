Why would you be an amazing ThoughtWorker?

One of my greatest passions, not only in my work but also in life, is continuing to learn different ways of reinventing old ideas and picking up new techs along the way. I thoroughly enjoy working collaboratively with others to achieve these things, as well as pair-programming in an agile environment which – based on my research – is highly attainable at ThoughtWorks.

I'm keen on working at ThoughtWorks in particular as I believe I share a similar passion about the power of technology and its ability to make a difference in the world. Being able to do what I love but also helping others in tandem would be highly rewarding, and I feel it would benefit my professional work and my desire to constantly advocate for change.

I'm convinced that your company would be the right place for me to start a career in Software Development, to expand my skill-set and equip me with the tools to be a fully contributing and innovative ThoughtWorker.

I believe in the importance of applying XP values in the workplace, and I think that working with those values in mind encourages experimentation and diversification as a means of finding new solutions.

I'm a good problem solver, and I truly enjoy the challenge of breaking down a problem and finding answers which can be applied in the real world. I’m fixated on code craftsmanship and take pride in writing elegant, test-driven code.








Jose note:

Like all Makers graduates i have a passion for learning new tech, the principles of Extreme Programming, craftsmanship  and working collaboratively.  I like to be able to take ownership of products and problems and finding solutions, as well as reflecting on mistakes and using this to power improvements.  I love working in Ruby and am also looking to increase the breadth of my tech exposure I've heard a lot about the Go programming language and would be excited to get the opportunity to work with the language at Credit Kudos.
