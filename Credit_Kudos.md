### WHY DO YOU WANT THIS JOB?

* It’s a great chance for learning and gaining experience (and experience is my main goal at the moment), working within a small team will allow me to explore and learn more about security, data science and machine learning.

* It’s a chance to work on a variety of interesting problems.

* They use Ruby (my favourite language) and RoR (my favourite framework), although I'd like to think of myself as a tech agnostic developer, it would be nice to work with familiar tools at least in the beginning... It will allow me to start contributing to the code base faster.

* Getting a chance to learn the best practices of TDD and BDD in an agile work environment.



### WHY SHOULD SKY HIRE YOU?
* I'm a good problem-solver, and I truly enjoy the challenge of breaking down a problem and finding answers which can be applied in the real world. I’m fixated on code craftsmanship and take pride in writing elegant, test-driven code.

* As someone who suffered the injustice of traditional credit checks in the past I like the idea of being part of revolutionising this process, I'm very passionate about the idea and I believe my passion will drive me to contribute more.

* I'm a team player and I love pair/mob programming.

* I'm willing to learn anything, I don't have preferable language or tech (Tech agnostic), I'm also patient and fast learning, I take chance on every learning opportunity I get.

* I have some experience in the agile methodology and I practice XP values and believe in them. I think that working with those values in mind encourages experimentation and diversification as a means of finding new solutions.
